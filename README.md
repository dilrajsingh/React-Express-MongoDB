# GOAL
---
** ***Currently work in progress*** **

Goal here is to create a survey page that requires users to login using Google Authentication.
Users will use Stripe's credit card payment method system to acquire credits to be used on the website. All transactions will be mocked.

(it may be down as I am working on it)

# Features
----
  - This application will demonstrate my knowledge in primarily React, Redux, Express.js, and MongoDB.
    - the MongoDB uses mLab to help create it on the AWS Sandbox which is free!
    - Passport.js along with cookie-session middleware was used to take care of the Google Authentication.
