# React-Express-MongoDB
---

# GOAL
---
** ***Currently work in progress*** **
Goal here is to create a survey page that requires users to login using Google Authentication.

Here is a link to the Heroku server where you can login with your Google account (it may be down as I am working on it):
https://react-express-mongodb.herokuapp.com/auth/google

# Features
----
  - This application will demonstrate my knowledge in primarily React, Redux, Express.js, and MongoDB.
    - the MongoDB uses mLab to help create it on the AWS Sandbox which is free!
    - Passport.js along with cookie-session middleware was used to take care of the Google Authentication.
